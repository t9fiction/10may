                <p>The number of participants is limited to 99 since I'll visit every single member for 1 week. If you have some friends or contacts who are also entrepreneurs, I would like to introduce them to the network, and if they're interested and would also like to buy in, we can have a voting about that. I'm going to keep 10% of the new buy ins. The other 90% will flow into our network investment pool, and we can decide together what to do with the money and how to invest it, again through voting. Later going contacts have all benefits of the project, expect the NFT with the rights for the liqueur brand, and my visit. I'll spend one week with you to learn more about your business, what kind of problems occurred how you solved them, and your individual way to success. My main focus is on getting to know your personality and to learn about your way of becoming a successful entrepreneur. During my stay, you are free to show me how you live, your daily life. Starting with your morning routine and daily tasks over your business, free time activities, people you interact with and so on. In the end it's up to you, how you create my stay, as long as it's legal :D.</p>
                <p> I had an eye for real estate and interior design since my childhood. Maybe some of you remember the video game Sims. I used that only to create one mansion after another. It is my dream to be part of that industry one day, and I think it's time to actually make it come true.</p>
                <p>Whilst building the network, a big goal is to establish an international real estate network together that all members can benefit from. The properties should be free to use for members over a period of time every year. Besides that, the properties will be offered for rental, to generate income for the project to invest in new mansions.</p>
                <p>I will give my best to recruit contacts like construction companies, architects, interior designer etc. for the network. Becoming a member of Network Project opens up new possibilities for companies, with a high chance of receiving orders from the project itself, or other members.</p>
                <p>It is of course necessary to not overfill similar industries to avoid competitors within the network.</p>
                <p>If there is a great demand for a special industry expect, I will keep an eye out on that, and do my best to find a person who is suitable and let him join us.</p>
                <p>To make sure you're suitable for this project, it is necessary to run through an short application process. Every applicant needs to hand in a short introduction video in which he/she presents his/her business, this video also will be used as a first introduction for the community!</p>
                <p>I need to plan a travel itinerary to coordinate my stay with each member, and arrange paperwork and documents like visa etc. I would like to keep my travel itinerary between different members short to save time, money and of course to reduce CO2. It belongs to you if you'd like me to stay at a hotel (paid by myself, of course) or if you'd like to have me as a guest at your place. 8500 $BUSD are required to submit your application. The Tokens are going to be "blocked" from a smart contract system for the time of application (just like the deposit when renting a car, for example). As soon as you're accepted to become a member of Network Project, 35% of the Tokens will be sent to me as my salary for living and travel costs. The other 65% will be added straight to our community pool. If you're dismissed, the Tokens automatically get sent back to the wallet you sent them from. My plan is to visit the first 99 members of Network Project, each one for about one week, and every member out of the first 99 within three years.</p>
                <p>All benefits are naturally available as soon as you join into Network Project, regardless of my visit.</p>
                <p>There is so much more potential, and so many possibilities to complement each other and to profit from each other. Let's make Network Project something big together.</p>
                <p>I hope to see you soon as a member, and I can't wait to get to know you.</p>
                <p>Stay healthy and don't forget: Your network is your net worth!</p>
